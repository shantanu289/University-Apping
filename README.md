# University-Apping

Bonjour! 
Securing Summer Research Internships can get gruelling isn't it?
To alleviate the process, here is a database of about `240` professors from more than `35` universities across the globe. 
So far, the fields of interest include _FLuids_, _Thermodynamics_, _CFD(Computational Fluid Dynamics)_, _Controls_ and _Robotics_. 
You'll also find an email template along with the database and a document of the available summer programs, their deadlines and application details. 
Looking forward to widening the scope of these resources down the line :) 

Good Luck :)
