# University-Apping

Bonjour! <br />
Securing Summer Research Internships can get gruelling isn't it? <br />
To alleviate the process, here is a database of about `240` professors from more than `35` universities across the globe. <br/>
So far, the fields of interest include __FLuids__, __Thermodynamics__, __CFD(Computational Fluid Dynamics)__, __Controls__ and __Robotics__. <br/>
You'll also find an email template along with the database and a document of the available summer programs, their deadlines and application details. <br/>
Looking forward to widening the scope of these resources down the line :) 

Good Luck :)
